# shinysem

This is an app designed in `shiny` to streamline the process of designing and analysing a Structural Equation Model (SEM).
Currently there is a learning curve to conducting SEM directly in `R` using `Lavaan` and other packages.
On the other hand, SEM software such as AMOS, PROCESS, and others have a number of limitations and annoyances in their design.
